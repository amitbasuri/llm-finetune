            "so this will be a benchmark day we'll look back on that fondly Chuck what's been bugging you lately I'll tell you I don't know if it's bugging me maybe I'm happy about it maybe maybe the entire human race has something to be hopeful about and you know how I feel about climate and the climate crisis right so they they I wake up this morning and it's all about fusion fusion everywhere everybody's talking about fusion fusion fusion I'm like whoa whoa is this a good thing or are they yanking my chain are they just making me what are they doing are they are they doing the Lucy pull the football away from me what is happening what is happening with the fusion oh okay so uh the Highlight is at one of the National Laboratories uh Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories where they they among all the National Labs are one of their major tasks is as Shepherds of our nuclear Arsenal okay the nuclear fuel basically so radioactive materials that might be used in weapons and it is funded by the department of energy not the Department of Defense so that in fact the total amount of money we spend on defense is not only the dod's budget but an important fraction of the Department of Energy's budget that involves uh Weaponry basically okay right yes so there they have the world's most powerful laser and what they do with a bunch of these lasers is they aim them all at a tiny Target and they cause the target to explode all right okay sounds like America so far so if the target is uniformly heated you know evenly in all directions and the material is very uniform in all directions so that would be a spherical shape then the explosion creates an implosion on the other side of that explosion right you can't just have stuff come out unless the Newton's law for every action is an equal and opposite reaction so reaction explosion that comes out creates an explosion that points inward okay very high pressure and very high temperature and under those conditions you can take two atoms light atoms right and merge them into a heavier atom sweet that takes a lot of high temperature to accomplish because let's take the lightest atom of them all which is what I don't know maybe hydrogen hydrogen you got it so hydrogen in its nucleus has one proton right and helium in its nucleus has two protons plus two neutrons so how am I going to create a helium atom from a hydrogen atom so you got to get a bunch of hydrogen atoms together all right together together well here's the here's what no one is telling you in the news but it's obvious when you think about it what do two protons want to normally do they're probably positive charge they don't they they like each other but they don't like each other because they're alike okay it's like when you it's like when you meet somebody at a cocktail party and they remind you of yourself and you're just like I don't like that dude I don't really like that I won't be over there talking to that dude Tucker's still in therapy people I know exactly like it's a simple question Chuck where did cocktail parties and liking people come in yeah but they they want to get away from each other right so these are like charges they're so in the case of two protons they repel so right how do you get them to come together as a new helium nucleus if they want to repel so this is like rolling a ball up a hill all right if you don't give it enough energy it's not going to reach the top it's not going to reach the top okay there you go so yeah if you roll it faster and faster giving it more and more energy eventually the ball will reach the top and tip and go over and fall on the other side of the Hill that is precisely what's going on with two protons here it goes the two problems want to come near each other but they repel let's boost the temperature which speeds everything up they get closer to each other before they repel boosts the temperature some more they get even even closer there's a magic temperature at which these protons will come close enough so that an entire new Force operates it would have to be a strong force in the nucleus to keep two protons together in fact the name of that Quantum love he he that's called Quantum love oh okay where's that disco so I remember Jungle Love remember Jungle Love uh yeah Quantum love is like Consciousness until you cross over the barrier and then you're there so when they cross that barrier a strong force that operates in the nucleus takes over it's one of the fundamental forces of nature and it's called the strong nuclear force there it is okay that's what it's called it is a very shortrange Force it only operates on scales as small as the nucleus itself wow but you have to get there for it to grab a hold of you and make a new atom that's why it takes high density pressure and high temperature to overcome that all right so that is um that is Thermo nuclear fusion Thermo is hot nuclear is the nucleus right Fusion they're bringing it together it turns out that when you do that your products have less mass than when you started with whoa my gosh where did the man yeah go exactly E equals m c squared you might look my lovely so the mass on the one side of the equation if you lose it it manifests on the other side of the equation as energy there you go there it is and so they match Fusion so at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories using lasers and by the way they've led the world in lasers like for decades in fact people on the inside call it lasers lasers and lasers okay Lawrence Livermore National Lab okay lasers lasers and lasers lasers right right so so anyhow so they have managed to you can add up how much energy it takes to turn on the lasers and fire them and then look at how much energy comes out after you've done this and they got 50 percent more energy out of this than the energy of the lasers that went into it that's amazing amazing first time that's ever happened now that now that's it now that's an energy source now because you got more out than you got in which is what I want to know which is so what what did it take what would it what would it be what did it measure like is it anything significant percentagewise that's great but like what would it take to turn this into it if it just broke even that would be a mess unto itself right but the fact that they got 50 more energy out than they put in it's it says oh my gosh we can get the physics to succeed and for my money I'm saying if the physics works then it's just a matter of time before Engineers I got this I got that I'm gonna make something out of that I got that and so that's amazing yeah and so I'm very much look forward there's a civilization pivoting on this result and by the way what I just described to you the sun does every moment of its life the problem over all these years is of course we've known how to make fusion we've got we didn't know how to make fusion since about 1949 or something but the first Fusion bombs are called hydrogen bombs they're using hydrogen that's what I just told you we two protons is merging hydrogen atoms nuclei together so we've known how to make fusion forever right the challenge is not how do you make fusion how do you control it yeah because you don't want the electric company um having to move to a new city because there's no City left right exactly foreign so while in America America we're really good at blowing stuff up we're less good at controlling that explosion right so the Holy Grail was can we undergo fusion in a controlled way where one day you might be able to throttle it or contain it or transport it and we'll finally get maybe that ending scene in Back to the Future right here's your cue doc Marty it's your kids and do you remember how uh you know and and and Marty says but doc we're gonna get the energy there's no lightning bolt and there's no room for you know how what are you gonna do and remember what he does he dumps a bunch of trash into uh the flux capacitor which is now powered by Fusion it's Mr home Fusion right it was like a like a blender that's right it puts it in and that undergoes nuclear fusion and so one day perhaps we'd have Fusion reactors in every car and then you could like wow there it is so so this one that transformed civilization even yeah regardless of the carbon footprint that it doesn't have it would transform civilization but it also happens to not have a carbon footprint so we could Stave off this growth of fossil fuel Burning uh and greenhouse gases and we'll still have to recover from the damage we've already done because a lot of the carbon dioxide got up took into the oceans and if you start removing it from the atmosphere it begins to come out of the oceans and it'll do that until it becomes equal again so you gotta like recover that but right it is the future and just I might tip my hat to this physicists and engineers at the National Labs and this whole thing was important enough it was a press conference announced by the Secretary of Energy so oh yeah yeah we're chomping at the beginning so then it is good news good news I suspected accurately yes all right had we been at it for decades just thought I'd tell you that and so this will be a benchmark day uh the first week in first and second week of December in the year 2022. we'll look back on that another day in December that will live not in infamy what is it when it's a good thing for me just feel me okay all right Chuck we gotta end it there all right all right but it's way more about like Fusion that's another show we'll talk about stars yeah it's more and why stars explode all right I I'll leave a teaser here you ready fusion you get energy by combining little atoms Vision you get energy by splitting big atoms okay but wait a minute there's got to be some point in the Middle where these two phenomenon meet what happens then therein is the or the the seeds of the undoing of great massive stars in the universe that's a whole other explainer we'll get to oh yeah nuclear fusion in a nutshell this has been at yet another Stark talk explainer great to have you join us uh putting Fusion back on the map Chuck always good to have you always pleasure Neil deGrasse Tyson here keep looking up\n",

            "Segment 1:\n",
            "hi chuck i got another explainer for you oh well i'm here to get it yeah yeah there's no end of these i don't think that's well no i will run out at one point my brain will be empty and i'll just be this this vessel right that i used to have stuff in it a hollow cell a hollow shell it's all online at that point i'll need to do some one of these one of these uh consciousness uploads to get my brain back from everything i put on online but i i have to address something that i think we've seen in the news you know every six months goes by and then you see a headline oh uh astrophysicists have to rethink the big bang or big bang debunked or or did you did you see any of these at any time oh my god but well recently the james webb space telescope supposedly the headline is um did the james wells webb's telescope um make scientists think the rig the big bang or has the james webb telescope debunked the big bang yeah it makes excellent clickbait yeah there it is it's it's click bait headlines so let me just explain a few things that's going on here okay uh on the frontier of scientific research it is a bloody place all right ideas are slayed two scientists enter one scientist leaves it's the octagon welcome to science dome on the frontier ideas are contested daily right and most ideas turn out to be wrong all right so so what you are as a scientist working on the frontier you're in this idea factory that's what you are and the successful idea is not the one that's argued most strenuously or argued by the most articulate that's called politics it's called politics exactly exactly uh it's not it has nothing to do with either of those it has to do with evidence all right which idea is supported by evidence so typically what happens is you can test your ideas and here's where you have to be convincing you have to say i i think my idea is better than your idea and here's a way to test it right so i have an idea so if you don't like me the way you show it is you design an experiment to show them wrong okay well that's some cutthroat nasty stuff that's some cut this is some nasty all right that's some real housewives stuff real housewives let me tell you something phaedra your hypothesis is trash so scientists can test their ideas so you uh you don't like me and you're gonna show me that i'm wrong and so you go home and you invent an experiment you invent an experiment to test my idea with the objective of showing that i'm wrong and it turns out hey wait a minute i'm getting what the dude says right you got to publish that and then someone else performs performs another kind of experiment aimed at testing the same hypothesis and they get kind of the same result and then someone from a different country with a different wall current 240 volts maybe and they plug their stuff in and they're getting the same result when you have repeated experiments verifying an idea we have a new objective truth that has emerged in those sciences and what i'm telling you is that the big bang theory by the way if you type that into google you get the tv show just i'm my personal jury is still out on whether that's a good or bad thing um you know it doesn't mean like science is so popular it's a tv show that's the first thing you hit because you got to get through that then there's the big bang is a kpop group you got to get through that then you get to the origin of the universe okay in the google search just thought i'd point that out it's good to know that we google in order of importance there it is just saying wow all right so so here's the point the tenets of the big bang that the universe started out small hot dense uh where matter and energy were a primordial soup where the forces of nature had merged all of that is thoroughly supported by observations of this universe thoroughly supported okay now there are some things that well did this really cause that or might it be something that we don't know about yet and who ordered up the dark matter we don't know where that came from and where's this expansion we don't know where that came from but we can describe it and we can measure it here's the point if tomorrow you have a new idea about how the universe works it's going to enclose everything we've been talking about up to that moment that has been experimentally and observationally verified you can close it in something deeper okay you can say oh and i have an idea our universe is just one in a multiverse fine okay but our universe would have started with a big bang okay and our universe would have expanded from a dense hot cool state and it's been cooling ever since that's observed and that's real and that's not going away that's my point so so what you have are journalists trying to make click bait and if there's some little thing in the early universe that is still on the frontier still being contested in the octagon in this in the in the fight dome and and some new idea is emerging over another idea oh big bang is in trouble so i just go back to the drawing but big man is not in trouble right i'm just saying it's not in trouble it is a whole thing that could conceivably fit in a deeper bigger idea right but it's not going to be swapped out tomorrow we're not going to find out tomorrow gee uh the early universe was cold instead of hot that's not going to happen that's not how science works so if you're going to come up with something new you're not coming up with something that will change the old all you have to the all that has been experimentally verified right if you're going to come up with something new about the earth and the sun it's not going to be well it's really earth is stationary and the sun moves around the earth and the sun is cold and earth is hot and earth is what's illuminating the moon that is not going to happen right right okay you can't just pull an idea out of your orifice and ignore experimental verification of what's going on right so you might you might come up with the big fang but you're not changing the big bang what what's the best c plus on that one it's what came before the big bang we call it the big thing the big thing okay that's a b plus if that's what's your thing yeah that's before the big bang so and and by the way the when we think of einsteinian physics so it's relativity which completely uh usurped newtonian gravity and newtonian motion all right what we call clot the error of classical physics which led right up to the late 1800s newton's ideas reigns supreme all right and he told you what gravity did what motion did and acceleration in a preexisting space and it was working okay it was working and then people said well wait a minute uh the orbit of mercury is not really following newton's laws and we said oh we got this we know we got this there's a there's another planet you can't see that's tugging on it we even had a name for that planet it was called vulcan okay we a hypothetical planet tugging on mercury so that we didn't have to throw out newton's laws all right so that was invoked just out of do we just pull that out of our ass right said there it is we'll find it one day einstein comes along with a special theory of relativity and then his general theory of relativity and what we find is that at high gravity like near the sun and at high speeds at high gravity and high speeds newton's laws completely fail you cannot use them at all so do we say did we throw away newton no we didn't you know why because if you take einstein's equations and plug in low speeds and low gravity they become newton's equations yes so einstein basically enclosed newton's ideas as a special lowspeed lowgravity case of a much larger deeper understanding of the universe fantastic it's it is it is beautiful it is and so so and by the way newton's uh newton's uh gravity and newton's motion went just fine for the apollo project right we got to the moon and back without any einstein relativity at all okay so it's only if you really uh um up the stakes in your gravity there's no wonder way to understand black holes really with or even the big bang itself with just newtonian physics point is new physics does not undo experimentally verified physics that's the whole point of experimental verification that's all look at that and so the big bang is just fine you want to do something else with it take it body and soul and stick it in some other theory you have but you can't undo what the experiments and observations have shown and that is an explainer for you there you go wow that is good take that big big bang deniers take that um so that's that's an explainer from the octagon from the scientist fight club there it is science fight club i love it all right so we got to end it there chuck

            "this is star talk explainer edition neil degrasse tyson here your personal astrophysicist guy with me chuck knight jack hey hey neil what's happening you love you those explainers don't you that's right uh because uh it's the one time where i don't have to do anything explain it and normally when i have to do explaining i'm in a little bit of trouble so this is really very pleasurable for me well we couldn't let this go by the first images from the james webb space telescope launched back chris december 25th christmas morning 2021 yeah uh went out to a million miles from earth in the opposite direction of the sun to drink in the universe yeah all its glory yeah and i know a little bit about the james webb space telescope but i'm not on their payroll okay we got better people than me to talk about this thing and so we combed the landscape and we found nicole colon nicole welcome to star talk hi thanks for having me nicole you are the correct me if i'm right here the deputy scientist for exoplanets for the web james webb space telescope that's specific at all i know it's not a mouthful at all but that's me that's me that's right that's you great and where do they house you uh i am housed uh actually at nasa's goddard space flight center which is in greenbelt maryland right outside washington dc basically just outside the beltway i guess is that right yeah so nasa has i last i counted 10 centers how many centers care or we all care but how many centers have direct control over what the telescope is doing uh i believe that's one you guys control the telescope nice nasa goddard yeah we play i mean okay to be fair there are scientists right at all the centers who are using of course and around the world of course yeah absolutely around the world but goddard manages the project okay got it and and what about the the old sleepy hubble telescope space science institute it's so funny when you say that i just hear hubble just going i'll tell you what what i was i remember i remember when it was really difficult to get images of a deep field i was the first to do it let me tell you how we did it in my day for all these fancy folding telescopes came along we did it in the snow well and you know what now jwst doesn't does what hubble did before breakfast basically there's a punchline yeah not too much that's some cold stuff you need a more polite way to say that but to be fair yes hubble okay we would not be here today without hubble right i mean 30 plus years discoveries that paid our path that set us up yeah and i see that poster behind you that's not a virtual image right that's a real it's just unfolding the universe has got an image of of the telescope i see what you did there i see we see what you did there tell us what you did there oh we did that we went there we are unfolding the universe because we had to unfold the telescope to see the universe so it was because the telescope had to fit inside of a fairing it's absolutely launch fairing and rather than make a telescope as wide as the mirror that you needed what did you guys figure out how to how to do that well we knew we needed a giant telescope it's about 21 feet across in diameter and we knew the largest rockets just couldn't launch it so we had to fold the thing up and yeah and it even then it just barely fit in the rocket it reminds me of those planes on the aircraft carriers that oh yeah with the wings that fold up wait but nicole in all fairness it's not that the telescope just barely fit it's that it was designed to just barely fit because you want to eke out every millimeter of space for the telescope in the fairing right absolutely yes we wanted what is the largest thing we could build to unfold the universe as we say you know to look at it with our our now what we have an infrared eye in space and allow me to say there would be no astrophysicists on the frontier of anything we're not for clever engineers empowering our dreams is that fair nicole oh yes there have been thousands i think up to something like 20 000 people who have contributed to this project and a lot of those are engineers and and you know what's what's sad to me is you know when these images come out they always interview the scientists and not the engineers that most of the engineers are sort of silent heroes in this effort so let me just give a a loud shout out to the silent thousands of engineers who made all this happen not only within nasa but with the with the corporate partner uh northrop grumman and and others who participated uh so nicole this is a huge telescope but how big is its field of view so web was designed really to do kind of deep but small images so it's not it doesn't have a gigantic field of view actually but it can do really deep images and see really far back in time actually so if you wanted to have a big area you'd have to mosaic multiple sets of exposures no no panoramic feature like my iphone has a background so i can do that what kind of cheap ass telescope is this get steve jobs on the case i don't know if your iphone can see galaxies though just whoa oh oh look at that the gauntlet has been thrown down yeah first blood drawn right there blood drawn nicole remind me where jwst was launched from it was launched from a place called french guiana and that is french wait what's the matter space coast florida is not good enough yeah jack wizards we needed this really big rocket right to launch it and that had to come from uh this company called aryanspas so we worked with them and that's their launch site so i didn't get to go to the launch site but that's okay okay but other folks did and isn't that closer to the equator than it is yeah and so you get that little extra boost um because the equator is moving faster than other latitudes on earth and if you launch east you get that extra rotational boost oh that's kind of cool it's kind of cool yeah it's like the earth is helping like giving you a little toss just a little toss that's exactly right so in what other ways did other organizations or countries participate in this well our two primary partners so besides nasa it was the canadian space agency and the european space agency and they both provided instruments and scientists to work on the mission with web and now you know we're here today again 20 000 some people across the globe have contributed to this project so so nicole that first image that we all saw which got leaked leaked a day before the press conference because you're fresh off the press conference at the time of this recording i saw an image before the press conference and was shown to me by president biden so is that allowed well i mean i i think if the president has an ask you probably don't say no you know he it's it's good news right we want him after all right he is he is the president we are more than happy to give the president good news to share yeah he's more than happy for you to give him that good news believe me but if if i know chuck he tried to extort something out of the president for that's right i don't know yeah like you know there's certain there should be a little budgetary bump for you guys waiting like right little christmas bonus for uh look up take nasa's nasa's annual budget yeah giving the president the put his day in the sun or his day and the stars as it were so that first image nicole i remembered it was a it's a galaxy cluster showing distant galaxies uh gravitationally lensed around it brilliant first target yeah for that but there were four other images is that correct shown at the press conference yeah yeah so we have five total targets that were released um everything came out mid july july 12th here we are and they covered basically representations of what webb will do over the next years to come and just to be clear my first understanding of web but that understanding would be significantly grown and modified over the years because the web has been in the planning since like the 90s at least so it was presented as a telescope that could see the birth of the universe the birth of galaxies in the early universe by focusing on infrared part of the spectrum but if you do that infrared is also because here we have chuck our guest doesn't specialize in galaxies in the early universe she specializes in excellent planets so what so so nicole what has infrared done for you i know we've uh exoplanets has risen you know and we're taking over it's a hot thing yeah well okay to be fair right so when webb was first conceived we hadn't really discovered exoplanets yet so exoplanets is a pretty young field so you couldn't even be on the docket at the time people first met at these meetings you didn't even have you didn't even have a job i know well you were completely unemployed you were like you were like put this thing up there man i need a job yeah you know it's it's been a great journey because we've gotten our message in there right now that we discovered all these so we okay so this accounts for why my awareness has evolved of what the capacity of the telescope is because whole branches cottage industries within the field of astrophysics have risen up in the era of the design and construction of the telescope so this is a beautiful fact yeah now we can study so when web was first being designed we started discovering the first giant like jupitersized planets and we said okay cool we can use web to study this in the infrared because that tells us new things about these planets and their atmospheres but then now where 5 000 exoplanets later we now know one's the size of earth and we can push webb to look at those so we didn't know about any of these tiny planets when web was designed but just to be clear chuck yeah she says 5000 exoplanets later right okay in in 1995 there was one known exoplanet so it's not an additional 5 000 to an already versioning catalog it's 5 000 on top of zero wow so so nicole one of these images was like yours or or you in your in your wheelhouse so which image was that yeah so that that's the that's the trick right okay so we use image but it was actually a spectrum so it wasn't a pretty image like you know you saw these amazing galaxies and star forming regions and all that right but the thing is we wanted these first images and data to be really kind of representing what the community will be using the telescope for in the next year and that is what we call transiting exoplanets and planets that transit we can't actually take direct images of because they orbit really close to their star so we're we're seeing the effect a planet has on its star as the planet moves in front or transits its star so we're seeing the planet move but only by measuring how the star light changes okay we're not seeing the planet directly so that's the star dims i guess because it's just sitting in front of it exactly so so how much can you tell from a dip in light that's coming from a star i mean it seems like a very limited amount of information yeah so that's the thing right so we say okay we're watching this planet block some light from the star then you add that the planet has an atmosphere this is really tiny amounts we're talking about but that atmosphere will block some of that starlight and basically cause an extra dip so we can measure that at like the parts per million level essentially jesus wow so it's ridiculously tiny essentially how do you know it's not like a sunspot or an alien vessel or anything or a dust cloud right or how do you how do you know how you know well the nice thing is we we have science okay nicole nicole i'm sorry because you can't do that here all right our answer or star talk can never be a look at science all right no what am i going to say all right it's science but that's cool but that's the good thing okay i say that right that's the best i love that answer nicole chuck is giving you a hard time i know but no you sound like my mama mom i don't understand everybody else go to the party why can't i go to the cause i said so that's why i said you can't go to the party all right that's it cause i'm your mother that's why okay let us let us allow nicole to explain further okay all right go yes so what i mean right is that we have done experiments even on earth where we know we want to look for water we know water has a chemical fingerprint that's what i mean by science right so each molecule in the universe has a chemical fingerprint and when we look up at a planet in front of its star we're looking at the starlight filter through the atmosphere there's a chemical fingerprint there so we can use our science right use our data to say we predict water will be here in this light and then we see it or we don't see it right okay so this won't work if the planet has no atmosphere exactly right right yeah so this is so cool it has an atmosphere yeah so what so do you do that kind of like spectral thing and if you see no atmosphere is it just like like our moon is it or or could it be like a planet do all planets have atmospheres pretty much if they're big enough yeah if they're big enough if they have enough gravity they'll have enough yeah yeah right yeah they hold on to that because molecules of gas are fast moving and they really want to escape but you have enough gravity it'll hold them they'll hold you it'll hold you down yeah cool yeah so cool so so nicole what you're saying is your spectra is sufficiently exquisite der i use that word that whatever molecules in the atmosphere of the transiting planet are there they're influencing the starlight passing through them damn yeah at this tiny okay parts per million levels i'm gonna tell you right now that is that's pretty mindblowing man that's and you're seeing this from light years away yes unbelievable and the image okay so the data we released today that star is over a thousand light years away so it's not even nearby and that's that's why it's so exciting because and what's the what's the mass on that or the the approximate size of that exoplanet yeah that planet so it's a little bit larger than jupiter actually well i say a little bit it's uh 1.2 or so times the size of jupiter meaning it's quite a bit larger than earth and then what kind of star is it is it like our star it is yeah it's a star similar to the sine similar temperature size pretty normal star as we would say okay so nicole it used to be that exoplanet people were just interested in the existence of exoplanets and how big their orbits were and how many planets there were and now you're now you're looking for life on them right that's a whole new place to be wow and i guess back then they couldn't ask deeper questions than just these basic physical ones about you know the orbital properties so you so you owe your livelihood to the power of the telescope to answer questions that we couldn't even ask back in my day yeah yeah we you know every time we start something new like this we're going to look at planets that are earthsized we can predict what we'll see but there's always things that we're not going to expect and then we have to figure out what they are so each image then nicole represented a branch of study for the telescope's abilities so i we got one which was the distant universe early galaxies um gravitational lensing we have your spectra of the chemistry of exoplanets so what were the other three yes so we have um a another galaxy image but it was an indepth called stefan's quintet and so it's five galaxies that are relatively nearby and they're interacting so that's a really neat thing there and so you see stefan's quintet yeah what do you mean what do you mean by interacting oh so all galaxies are always moving and away from each other or moving towards each other and so this is a grouping where they eventually can basically come together and morph into each other and like strip each other of stars and whatever to form a brand new galaxy later on this is a galaxy hoedown it's a hoedown it's a galaxy and what's what's fun about it is when galax galaxies are extended objects they're not points of of gravity they're extended and so when two galaxies see each other and feel each other's gravitational forces they begin to distort each other according to the strength of gravity across their their physical size which is not the same right because if you're the distant point that's going to feel a little less gravity than the point that's close up and so as a result you get this shredding of a galaxy as it comes near another guy it's a beautiful it's like a beautiful train wreck um would you agree nicole that they're gorgeous yeah also okay the most mindblowing thing to me about that quintet is all the galaxies behind it too there's just like the field is photobombed with galaxies so okay the ones in front are fascinating absolutely but then it's like behind there what the heck is going on oh my gosh because i grew up you know because like i said me and stefan's quintet go way back but in the pictures of stefan's quintet that's kind of the only action in the photo so you're saying so you're saying the james webb space telescope even if your professional scientific interest is stefan's quintet somebody else might be able to use the data that happened to be in the background of your image to study something else yes there's just data there's galaxies everywhere essentially okay so now we've got three of the images what are the other two so there was also an image of a dying star so it's a planetary nebula they call it but it's one of these beautiful it has like shells of material around it basically the star has died a star like our sun and it has evolved and shed its outer layers over time and it's created these like bubbles of material where there's interactions with gas heating each other heating other gas up and and spreading elements out through the universe so it's like this beautiful transition of a dying star and it's feeding the universe now does that have a colloquial name for it um for that nebula it does because chuck we name our stuff whatever this thing looks like we name it you know there's a pacman nebula out there did you know that i saw that the pacman which i love what's the dying star nebula well this one is let me let me guess let me let me guess it's called american health care the american healthcare nebula it's a well it's a little simpler than that okay it's the southern ring nebula okay not even interesting southern ring okay but if you look at the image yeah there's there's a bunch of rings like of material so yeah i think that's where the name come from as creative as others that yeah okay give me one more image okay then there's karina this is a region another nebula yeah with star formation but this one is like zoomed in you're seeing just incredible amounts of gas and dust like you're seeing through the gas and dust to see stars forming behind it and heating up the gas and dust and i'm telling you you have to look at these images high resolution online you know because you can just zoom in for days and see this material just keep zooming in yeah something you couldn't do with hubble you can zoom in a little bit and that was good in its day right it was good enough for us i'll tell you that we didn't need all these fancy high resolution pictures we used our imagination and we make calculations on pen and pencil okay so you pity nicole because there's nothing left for her imagination yeah she's all there that's what you're saying yeah oh my gosh we're not we're not done you know this is just the beginning well i love that set of five images and it's quite the breadth of the what the capacity of this telescope is and can be so spend another minute telling me about the administration of the telescope so what happens at the goddard uh space flight center again yeah yeah so i'm that's where i'm based at in in maryland and um goddard manages the project it's actually where the observatory was built in part so we have a big clean room and that's um on its journey it basically went around the country um before it went off into space uh but its operations like day to day every day are based in baltimore maryland up at the space telescope science institute okay which is where uh hubble you know cut its teeth right i mean that's the that was built i think to handle the report yeah i remember correctly yeah yeah so now it's handling the next big thing so uh hubble is in the record books for being uh was it the the most number of collaborative papers of any science experiment or any science project uh do we expect web to exceed that oh gosh i mean i mean in every metric so total number of papers total number of scientists total number of countries all the important measures that bring scientists together in the world in harmonious ways yeah okay so with web you have let's see it started over 20 years ago we have over 20 000 people from across the globe who have contributed yeah we have um scientists uh from all over the globe that will use it i think you know that so the design mission lifetime was five and a half years after launch but we're looking at way before 10 because the launch was perfect so we have all the fuel we need to support our orbit so we're looking at 10 maybe even 20 years so if you imagine you know how many astronomers can use a telescope in 20 years and right yeah yeah that's a lot and by the way one of the lagrange points of the earth sun and we we have a separate explainer on lagrange points i think yeah we do yeah we did super cool yeah we did one on that so we don't have to lose time on that okay yeah so it's very good now yeah yeah very efficient place to put a telescope yes and do you foresee that anyone would go to it for to as a servicing mission is that is that in the foreseeable future for accrued space vehicles yeah maybe to white wipe down their reflectors you know give it a little give it a little squeegee you know squeegee you know yeah there's no bugs they got bugs on it on the way what is that what is that everything every image has something that looks just like a spider what is that oh yeah that's the answer maybe maybe robotic missions one day yeah robotic missions perhaps yeah yeah very cool is this one of these telescopes where all data are made public immediately or is there some sort of private time the scientist has who proposed the observing time so there is actually a mix so there's a good set of data that's only available or it is available immediately because we want people to make the most of it right away to prepare what they want to observe for next year you know we only have the first year of science set now we need to think about what we're doing for year two and so we need to analyze the current data we have so there's some data that's that's open right away that'll come out in a couple days from now and then other data will have like a 12 month we call it exclusive access period for the team who proposed it to work on it but then it looks like it's their idea it's their idea exactly right but it'll be all be public eventually for anybody in the world to access wow cool and so what rate do you think because the hubble has a i need the hubble voice chuck hubble has a website where all the beautiful pick the hubble heritage site and so where all the beautiful images went will there be such a sight for james webb i think so yeah between our nasa websites and the space telescope website there will be images galore for years to come so so this is great uh nicole this has been delight to have you on uh if you get some really cool result or you find aliens can can we be your first uh media outlet for that i'll call you up sure thing yeah just call call me up we will totally give you front row uh uh front row exposure because you're if you're looking at chemistry in the atmosphere is you're looking for the possibility of life because some chemicals are are are like biomarkers is that what you guys call them yeah yeah so we're we're you know we're starting slower slower than that so we want to first make sure that earthsized planets like our size the same size as our earth we want to make sure they have atmospheres in the first place and then we say okay what can we see in those then we run all our models and say what does that tell us are there bias signatures so you keep saying earthsized planets is that a prerequisite for life i mean can't you have a planet that it's admitting that we're completely biased i know yeah we had a whole telescope looking for earthsized planets around sunlike stars okay am i am i right nicole right the kepler that so that is total bias yeah who's to say that there can't be like you know a life on a jupitersized planet well that's why neptunesized planet exactly that's why we are looking at everything because we don't know we have to start with what we know right and then it's we gotta work from there so you gotta start somewhere okay so nicole my last question will this telescope have a serendipity mode any new uh access to the frontier of the unknown um often are designed to look for things that we think will be there okay that's part that's what creates the design specs for practically anything that's built but there might be things you never thought of and so does this telescope have a mode where it just looks anywhere just in case something shows up that we didn't even know to ask well i think i think yes is the short answer because using stefan's quintet as an example we wanted to look at that grouping of galaxies and what happened we saw a countless number of galaxies behind it right so that's what we're going to see i think in every data set there might be a serendipitous discovery of something got it got it okay because it's so good at what it does exactly the serendipity will come and bite you in the ass when it's it's something that's going to happen yeah but when you see the alien mothership just happen to drift into view you're gonna you're gonna have a high res uh image way better than any navy pilot obtained from an f18 fighter fighter jet the alien photo bomb can't wait can't wait all right nicole we got to call it quits there it's been a delight to have you on uh good luck with this sometimes you need a little bit of that too as you know but where can we find more about what nasa's been up to i heard naza has a podcast is that right oh yeah there's uh something called the curious universe so if you're curious about webb uh you can go there and hear more about all the exciting things happening in the images that came out is it right off of nasa.gov yes yes you can go to nasa.gov for all your resources or other social media at nasa web as well okay and i tweeted at web just a few days ago and the web twitter address is nasa web i think webb at nasa webb so nasa has has been a longtime active player in the social media universe it's good to see them there uh it's part of what helps keep nasa relevant and part of our dreams can't follow that with anything no we got to end it right there right there what are you going to do i mean how am i going to screw up the future with a joke after that that's right this has been star talk and explainer the delighted for nasa to lend us nicole colon give us some insights into the james webb space telescope always good to have you chuck always a pleasure all right neil degrasse tyson here you're a personal astrophysicist keep looking up you\n",

            "I still lose sleep over this fact okay I still lose sleep over it and I want you to lose sleep too I don't want to be the only one staring at the ceiling at night I'm GNA tell you uh a lot of things already beat you to that oh sure mean the asteroid strike that could happen or the exactly right right with the global warming or all right so here it is you may remember or you may have heard that Einstein's relativity right more more specifically you learn this in special theory of relativity where the faster you move right the slower time ticks for you right as others view it relative to The Observer relative to The Observer correct you don't know anything's happening right your clock still ticks as far you still got your your heartbeat all of this okay so this is not physiological thing is an actual property of the fabric of space and time under those conditions wow okay that is fascinating it is it's completely fascinating it's completely so I watch you fly by and the faster you go the slower time ticks for you okay but my time stays the same to you to me right to you so not only does speed do this also the strength of a gravitational field will have the same effect on you the stronger the gravitational field is the slower time ticks for you and that wasn't formulated until his general theory of relativity um 10 years later that took a lot more math and and and deeper insights into the universe so once again it makes sense because you're dealing with the fabric of SpaceTime it's the fabric of SpaceTime correct but initially when formulated you're thinking it's just because you're moving but it's it's it's actually way deeper than that and that's why that oh by the way his original special Theory relativity was not called that the title of the research paper was on the electrodynamics of moving bodies what okay that was that was the title we would later call it the Special theory of relativity because it was a special case of what would later then be called the general theory of relativity oh oh while we're there let me just slip this in the GPS satellites orbit higher than our um than our than like the space station and and other things that are in what we call lower Orit Mo Middle Earth orbit there Leo Mio and Geo okay if you have kids maybe you name them that yes Leo Mio and Geo low earth Orit Middle Earth orbit and geosynchronous geo geo orbit okay so the the geosynchronous satellites are are like middle orbit that is far enough away from Earth's source of gravity for them to have a different a measurably different SpaceTime condition oh so that their clocks tick faster than our clocks on Earth's surface because they're farther away and so remember I said the the more intense the gravitational slower the slower time tick so they're farther away their time ticks faster relative to us wow but we get precise timings from geosynchronous satellites so how does this work we prec correct the time signal from the GPS satellites to compensate for Einstein's general theory of relativity so that by the time the time reaches us what it's been properly corrected and it matters to us an our SpaceTime Continuum not the one that's in middlee orbit oh my goodness so GPS couldn't work as accurately as it does however wait a minute I'm sorry just for me you would have to have a standard in order to precorrected up because you can calculate what the gravitational field is up there there you go there you go okay okay and once you calculate that then you do and you say oh my gosh we the the the formula Works Einstein was right all right this is not just something on a the high Theory hypothesize that may or may not not be true it is true I just want to be there when that phrase is uttered oh my God Einstein was right yeah these aren't just cult Heroes that we wish they were right these are real this is real okay this is the real Universe we're talking about here okay so now watch let's keep going faster and faster let's go half the speed of light 34 of the speed 90 the speed of light 99 the speed of light time is taking slower and slower and slower for you you will watch the whole future history of the universe unfold in front of your eyes as fractions of a second go by for you as you go 99 there's a formula for this of course but 99 99.9 99.99 the speed of light because you're the Observer of that but for you your time has slowed to the point where As You observe the things that are not moving at the speed of light you see them speeding basically you see unfold correct boom God correct that is insane so now watch oh my God wait now watch okay wow so I didn't even get to the part where I lose sleep okay okay that's what happens by the way by the way um there are particles that decay you've heard of like radioactivity right yes it's one part it decays and becomes another part it releases often deadly energy yes okay radioactivity all right some particles let's take for example the uh proton uh or the the muon one of these uh it decays in like six minutes when it's left out in the in the wild okay when it's not part of an atom when it's not in captivity uh I forgot which of these but it doesn't matter for my example Decay is in like six minutes okay okay what happens if you take that particle and speed it up in a particle accelerator so you take a a a community of these particles speed them up calculate wait a minute the internal wristwatch on these clocks says they should live longer and sure enough their Decay time takes longer wow that's oh my God yes yes so oh wow yes and that becomes that becomes living proof of what Einstein said yes cuz we can't go half the light you can accelerate a particle to do that has an internal builin clock that decays after a certain amount of time and there they are taking longer to decay in the exact amount that Einstein predicts that is genius so we don't make this stuff up okay it yes it is genius this like triple genius all right now let's take this to an extreme level right let's go so fast that we're going the speed of light itself right right well we can't do that cuz we're made of material substance and that's there's no way to do that but there are things that travel at the speed of light and what is that uh those would be photons yes thank you I like those would be I like your finger gesture that would be I would say what travels at the speed of light light does yeah okay I was about to say light so if photons had a clock the clock would never tick nice which means when I go to a Mountaintop as I did in graduate school to observe the center of the Milky Way galaxy for stars that emitted their light 30,000 years ago traveling through the gaps of interstellar space and they move through space come through Earth's atmosphere they come down into the T scope they reflect go back to my detector and land on my CCD chip that Photon when it was born at the star that emitted it was detected at my telescope in the same instant wow according to the photon itself live fast Die Hard Fon has no knowledge of that trip right because time did not exist for it oh that's great and I'm saddened that many of these photons like hit people tanning on the beach you know and and to imagine Trav 30,000 years and land on someone's buttocks could with the telescopes I collected I'm now decoding the nature of the universe not and some photons go right on by Earth and are still moving but they have no internal time clock wow and they're just traveling through like I hope when I'm born I hit a telescope bam you're born and you're hit a telescope yeah yeah I would that would be an interesting but when I what do I want to be when I grow up you know or the instant I am admitted where am I going to be where would I like to be right right right and so just the idea that light can move across the universe and have no uh and not age this is a fascinating fact to me wow so yeah that is that is more than fascinating that is I mean that's mindboggling yeah yeah so that is light the age of light it's like it doesn't age at all I am convinced that all of you guys secretly micro do and smoke weed I'm just another episode that's what I'm saying another episode all right Chuck we're calling it qu there all right all right mysteries of light and time uh Neil grass Tyson here keep

            "Segment 1:\n",
            "so chuck i never give you a chance to ask me a question for one of our explainers anything been eating you lately well i mean since since you asked how about because this is something you hear all the time especially in jokes believe it or not really sh yeah schrodinger's cat wait you have a quantum division of the joke department well i don't think that the comedians know what schrodinger's cat is but it's such a uh it's such a ubiquitous reference yeah that they make reference to it a lot of times it's intercultural it's interesting it has interculture i don't know why they don't call it schrodinger's dog okay all right so all right so it dates back to irwin schrodinger uh who irin yes and he was a physicist right they're all one nobel prize is all these people who contributed to our understanding of the quantum right and quantum mechanics is what it's officially called but i like just calling it quantum physics because it's an entire branch of physics that deals with the small small things in the universe uh all that so you do sweat the small stuff yes you do i see precisely precisely and uh the schrodinger's cat relates a little bit to what people have called the observer effect okay where if you observe something you change it so i can respond to both of those in the same in the same pop if you allow me okay so let's do the observer effect for the moment so it's unfortunate that somebody called it the observer effect because then new age folk and other people who were basically scientifically illiterate were thinking it's your consciousness that affects what you're observing and oh my gosh there's a consciousness field and they go running off in a you know off the cliff see what you don't understand is that like particles are totally alive okay and the reason why there is a collective consciousness in the universe is because like all of these particles that are spinning what they're actually doing is conducting thought and consciousness they're thinking they're things they're thinking man rocks think trees think more than rocks right so let me let me cut through all of that and simply say that you're sitting there and i can see you because in fact you're illuminated by if not sunlight through an open window an uncurtained window but artificial light within the room all right that light hits your face bounces off your face goes through the computing system and i see you okay that light carries energy every photon of light that strikes your face carries energy and then they they most of them reflect others uh get absorbed actually depends on how dark your skin is it's getting very dark it'll absorb most of them if you have that because you know photons they want to be a part of this baby let me give something let me give you guys i see where we're landing yes just to be more precise about chuck's excursion there uh darker skinned people absorb more sunlight than lighter skinned people and it's your albedo it's a it's the percentage of incident energy that you absorb relative to what you reflect very important calculation for the earth because what earth absorbs drives our climate whereas what earth reflects back to space just goes back to space from the sun and so glaciers reflect light cloud tops reflect light oceans reflect light that sort of thing so for climate change to solve it we just need to get a bunch of white people in one place just reflect the light to reduce the do us a favor guys sunbathe everybody just sunbathe right here reflect out the sun okay all right i'm sorry i had to do it man all right don't write don't write don't write but it was good that was that was funny yeah that was a good one yeah i mean if you if the earth is getting hot you just just um increase its albedo to increase the reflectance of it so right yeah so uh instead of chuck's solution everyone could just wear white clothing and that would sure even better right that's so so here's the thing if i made you tinier and tinier and tinier right so you're no longer a macroscopic human you're a microscopic particle there's a particle size below which when you open the curtains and shine light on you that light will hit you and pop you into another location so i'm smaller than the photon then what the your whatever your your capacity to move to a different state of existence that the energy that that is required to make that happen correct energy the same as the energy of the light that's hitting you gotcha so you hit me with in order in order to see you right and then you pop somewhere else and i say where'd you go right what are you doing so am i there am i not there well we'll never really know because you're hitting me with something that makes me not there once you're exposing me to it correct and and since it happens on the moment you're exposed not the moment i see you right i will never know what you were doing exactly okay if you're small enough for that light energy to to affect you in that way so that's why we don't think about this in everyday life because we're too big for light to pop us into other states of existence exactly but particles electrons atoms nuke all of this it happens all the time and this was a very disturbing discovery in the 1920s we're in the centennial decade of the discovery of quantum physics in the 1920s because you discover this i want to see what you're doing oh my gosh you're not going to let me see what you're doing because the light i shine on you in order to see it is so so it's really uh it's not so much an observer effect it's a measurement effect exactly okay get the human brain out it's just the device to measure you you you can't know it okay right so so let's get on to so it has nothing to do with consciousness so let's get on to schrodinger's cat by the way it's from an era where people spoke lightly of doing bad things to cats okay oh no peter you know yeah but peter wasn't around so so i'm a little disturbed that they picked cats right they could have picked dogs they could have put worms but cats are lovable and they'll fit in a box right um and so because cat house cats don't come as large as house dogs do just think that through right can you imagine yeah a box for a dog is called your living room right so here's what happens you say to yourself um you put a cat in a box and if the cat is a quantum cat with two states states of existence it's either dead or alive while it's in the box you have no idea which it is and so the way we describe this in quantum physics if you do the experiments okay so some percentage of the time you open the box the cat will be alive others the cat will be dead and so you what we say is that the the cat's existence is a superposition of being dead and being alive i gotcha it's a superposition of those two states because it's in the box it's in the box and you're not looking at it and you're not looking at it and that's why the superposition exists correct and it's a quantum cat not a microscope it's not a it's not a it's not maru the internet cat that people love to see jump out of a box okay all right it's a hypothetical quantum cat by the way do you know cats on the internet uh took a steep rise the same year the cats on broadway closed the music really yes check your data on that that is a weird little so we need somebody we need somebody to investigate that because where did those cats go is what so it was like 1990 you know early internet you know uh and cats closes on broadway and so i think people needed their cat fix and they landed on the internet but anyhow so here we go now the superposition the details of that experiment are a more intricate thing than what i'm describing to you because what they wanted was to have like a something that's radioactive that would decay and then that would then trigger a gate that would open the box you know it's a little more rube goldbergian than what i'm describing but just to be clear if you don't look in the box you do not know if the cat is alive or dead so the schrodinger's cat is you're talking about something that you don't know about until you actually investigate it and then you'll end up the movie seven i didn't see that that was a movie that came out many years ago with morgan freeman and the beautiful man i forget his name oh god he's uh he did 12 monkeys he's done uh thelma and louise what's his name brad pitt thank you brad pitt of course brad pitt so brad pitt is stalking a serial killer who is looking who is using the seven deadly sins to kill people long story short the last murder he puts the head of someone in the box and brad pitt wants to know what's in the box and morgan freeman says don't look in the box there's no reason for you to look in this box and brad pitt goes what's in the box because he knows that it's his wife's head that is completely morbid like what what i don't know but it's perfect it should be called schrodinger's cat it should be called brad piff's white's wife's head and chuck that is the most morbid analogy to this example i have ever heard oh oh cause a dead cat is perfectly fine oh no okay so so this actually in a way applies to quantum computing which you might have heard snippets about or at least bits of headlines that are uh making the news so if you think of regular computing is like a zeros and ones bits right and all calculations are done in this way well quantum computing the i a bit a quantum bit otherwise known as a qubit can be either a zero or a one or anything in between okay it could be eighty percent one twenty percent zero fifty fifty eighty percent zero twenty percent one or anything on that continuum and so so the qubit has more computational versatility than a regular bit that can only be either a zero or a one and and the and the when i say you can be anywhere between a zero or one statistically you can have that bit represent eighty 80 ones 20 zeros uh 50 it can be any combination of those two in the service of the programming that you're introducing to the computer so all of that schrodinger's cat your dead wife's head in a box right from this morbid movie that now i'm never going to see um you were so excited about it too because it's so much better than schroedinger's cat okay it actually represents something that is consequential that you know i mean never mind it doesn't really make a difference it's i mean it doesn't make any difference once you're in the quantum it doesn't make a difference but it's just a much cooler reference right right because it's not a quantum head it's not a quantum head so it doesn't make a difference you know once you're in the quantum it's not a it's not a cat it's a quantum cat and it's not a head it's a quantum head so all right i see what you're saying it was never really a cat to begin with right it was a fictional quantum cat and the same way it's a it's a quantum head exactly exactly the world according to chuck that's so funny you're like chuck uh go have another bowl and get back to me so chuck there it is that's like you know schrodinger's cat 101. he could have should call it schronger's coin is it heads or tails right right exactly it's just is this is the quantum state only have two possibilities right in that description and so once you open the box and and thereby gain access to information that is otherwise hidden from any observer or any uh device that would make the measurement coin is actually the best representation since if it's a superposition like we said or like you said like i said right please look at me look at me taking credit for quantum discoveries however that means it's always a probability so probability correct it's always a probability so that means quantum coin is actually you came up with the best one why why you got to do that why you got to best me i come up with a head in the box and then you still got it you still got to outdo me really we our fans with a head in a box version of this i'm sorry and just to be clear the the quantum state doesn't have to be one or the other right it depends on the atom and or the circumstances but it can be any number of different states that each have a probability of being true exactly and in fact the wave function of the particle extends outside of the box oh so the probability dropped rapidly across the border of the box but it still exists in a little bit outside the box so what's inside the box has a probability of spontaneously disappearing from inside the box and appearing outside the box that's called tunneling and it does that instantaneously like faster than the speed of light another spooky freaky thing in quantum physics and that relates in part to quantum entanglement because you can have two different particles whose wave functions interact on a way that where you do something that one particle the other one knows about it instantly because their wave functions communicate this is quantum 101 it's like fun parts of quantum that is crazy so we should do a lot of these about quantum physics this was like an overview i could spend a whole explainer on each one of these things because this is the decade in the 1920s was a watershed decade in physics where hubble discovers that we that the milky way is not the only galaxy there are other island universes they were called um in andromeda is another galaxy containing 400 billion stars and four year three years later in 1929 he discovered that the universe is expanding and we apply einstein's relativity to show that we've got possibly a big bang which would later would make 50 years before we had the supporting data and most of what we now know understand and love about quantum physics was discovered in the 1920s and we knew all of that before the neutron was discovered and before texas instrument actually made a calculator uh yeah and why is that because that means these guys had to work that math oh i should just say okay before anybody made a calculator right right exactly uh exactly by the way i had a friend who had the very first texas instrument scientific calculator and he knew it was the first because it didn't even have a model number on it wow it predated model it would ultimately become the ti35 but we i remember we all crowded around it staring at it it was one of those moments that you never forget okay i just love the visual of a bunch of nerds cradling around and then you know you think they're looking at a magazine or something and then you part the ways and they're all around a calculator like whoa look at that can you believe this thing welcome to the geek verse the cosine do the cosine again now i'm a tangent man myself so i chuck we got to call it quits there all right we ran over the clock on this one but quantum physics deserved a few extra minutes we gave it i think absolutely all right all right till next time this has been a star talk explainer just for you neil degrasse tyson keep looking up\n",

            "so chuck it seems like we've done this before but you can't do it too many times and it's it's the number one lesson against traveling back in time what you don't realize neil is that we've actually done this a hundred times before i see what you did there yeah did you see that yeah okay i see what you i see what you did there so if there were a rule book of time travel the number one item would be you cannot go back in time and prevent your parents from meeting each other because then you would have never been born to have gone back in time to have prevented your parents from meeting each other this is the fundamental paradox of time travel and so that if there were a rule book that'd be number one rule right here's what movie people get wrong or they don't get it wrong they don't think it all the way through so what's the most famous of these movies where they can't have somebody get born what's his face uh the boy that with the hoverboard and uh no no no no not that one that has other rules you're not supposed to break down the whole thing was you gotta get your parents to smash because if they don't you're not born oh right but that was gonna happen anyway he just can't mess it up oh right okay okay okay the point is don't go back and stop oh terminator because you got to stop you got to stop okay i am looking for sarah connor i was told that she was here or your name is sarah connor i'll kill you anyway no matter what and killed every surrogate killed every serotonin okay so here's the thing so yes you wouldn't have a terminator movie if the terminator's sole job was to prevent sarah connor from becoming pregnant okay that's a different movie from killing systematically every sarah connor in the phone book right so and he didn't have to do that he could go one generation earlier and prevent the grandparents from eating or prevent the great grandparents from eating or the great great great parents i mean anywhere in that genetic chain if you disrupt it then you are not born and so introduce the great great grandmother to a much better looking guy and you just have a better looking time traveling there you go this is like that's a different terminator movie right exactly so so i'm just saying these people think they're on some loctite theme when the theme is way broader than that in fact uh forgive me for not remembering which movie this was it'll come to me in a moment where they realized that if two people if if two people had sex 10 minutes later than they otherwise did then a different sperm fertilizes likely the same egg and that's but it's nonetheless a completely different person wow so even if you don't disrupt the sex just delay it make the train come a little later make the you know uh have the the cup of coffee be extra delicious so they get a second cup before they or or the wine whatever is the romantic forces operating that evening make sure they have other kids because that will stop you from ever being able to do it again i mean five other kids are running around like you got to do you know this is just like i mean that's what i found out during the pandemic you know you in the house you'll be late man we've been here for a while what are we gonna do every time you try to disappear they show right up knocking on the door what are you guys doing what's going on in there okay so that's a time travel movie never never conceived see what i did there very nicely let's see what you did there it's you're trying to prevent the parents from having sex they're not having it anyway that's it because they've got five kids running upside down bouncing off the walls that's the other kids just like now in popular parents it's called the grandfather paradox but it's a paradox to any one of your ancestry because disrupting that chain will prevent you from being born someone else could be born now now you can you can get you can introduce a more interesting idea that maybe the forces of the timeline care about major events even in spite of you changing minor events that be an interesting fact right i i i don't really agree with that idea but it'd be an interesting scifi so is that kind of like inevitability so it's like even though you change these minor things the inevitable will still happen correct so it could be that you know you killed the some ancestor of yours so you don't exist but somebody else arises in the life of the other partner because you just have to kill one of the partners right that creates some other person who basically does exactly what you were gonna do in your life right so it's not you but the larger scale events still unfold and my favorite example of this which involves no killing at all is if you could communicate backwards through time we have a hypothetical particle that does that you know what it's called you never hear no it's called the tachyon oh tachyon okay tachyon and it's uh i think it's from the greek tacticos meaning fast yeah the tachometer it's the same route the tachometer which gives you the the the the speed of your engine uh if you're still having a rpm car yeah yeah the rpms that's a tachometer so we have this hypothetical part it's never been observed but we sort of introduce it it's called a tachyon it exists moving faster than the speed of light and as you may remember chuck as you go faster and faster and faster your time slows down relative to everybody else right at the speed of light time stops but what happens if you cross the speed of light then time goes backwards according to the equations so we are imagining if you could ever accomplish this time would go backwards for you so we introduced this particle it's called tachyons so now you have a tachyon texting smartphone okay and your buddy's walking down the corridor and you see your buddy slip on a banana peel and fall and you say i don't want my buddy to slip on a banana peel and fall so you pull out your tachyon text message service and you say watch out for the banana peel you send it to them after this event has already happened but they receive the text before it happens right you got this because it moved backwards in time right okay so then what happens is they're walking down the corridor and then the text alert happens okay so they pull out their smartphone and start reading the smartphone and it says watch out for the banana peel but the very fact of having pulled out the smartphone and looked at it meant they weren't looking down in that moment and they slip on the banana they slip on the peel so you caused the very event that you thought that you were avoid uh preventing correct correct and that's another inevitability scenario that where it would declare that there's nothing you can do about it in fact in h.g wells's time machine uh half the movie is weirdly in a future that he had no clue that he thinks would happen but the first part of the movie the protagonist goes back in time and he has a love interest he meets in the park but then she gets mugged and get and killed and he's very upset about this he said well i got a time machine let me go back and make sure that doesn't happen it goes back and says don't walk this way walk that way so she walks the other way crosses the street gets hit by a bus okay right and then she so three or four ways he's trying to save her life and then she dies every single time and he concludes it was her it was it was her time that is amazing that i you know what i didn't remember that part of that yeah i never read the book i actually saw the movie um that was only the two movies there's original you know from the 50s or 60s and then one more recently in the 90s yeah so but um what you just described is a marvel multiverse um doctor strange not the movie this was an animated where dr strange is in love with a woman who dies and he finds ways to keep going back in time and manipulating the timeline and she dies in every single timeline and so he loses his mind he he goes insane because he can't figure out how to save her well okay so there's another one of these inevitability things so we don't we don't know we don't know for me the fact that you existed in a past time displacing air molecules you might have stepped on a worm or an ant in the street to me that's changing the timeline right so you'd be cherry picking all the possible all the things that you caused and saying well this this one is more important than the rest but what's the molecule say dude you pushed me out of my way i was like there and now i'm not there that's a different universe as far as the molecule is concerned it's like so you go back in time right and you land at a cookout and you slap a mosquito on your neck but that mosquito was actually on its way to bite someone else that would have done the same thing and by slapping their neck while they were driving a car they ran into a tree and they died and that person ended up being a dictator who eventually took over the entire world chuck i don't know where it is i don't know where this story is going neil help me out neil what happens i'll help you out i'll i'll help you out there is a story where someone goes back in time warned not to affect not to touch anything right don't touch it and then he comes back and says i didn't touch anything and the scene ends as his foot is up on his knee and there's a dead butterfly in the bottom of his foot oh man and everyone and we're all nazis because of that butterflies so if there was some aircurrented cause that created a monsoon and a tsunami and a hurricane and whatever so that's it's called the butterfly effect in reference to that scene oh cool but anyway this all started talking about the grandfather paradox which could easily be a grandmother paradox there's no reason you have to specify gender in this it's an ancestry paradox is oh man you just gave it a new um term i mean another accessory yeah let's do it that's that's so much better the ancestry paradox because it works anywhere in your entire timeline that's right yeah you got it all right chuck it's all the time we have this explainer absolutely that's by the paradise now all we have is time long as we don't touch nothing as long as we don't touch nothing all we got is i'm teaching you too much see if you you think you know and then you only know some but you think you know all that's dangerous too all right this has been another star talk explainer the other guy section always good to have chuck always a pleasure\n",

            "Segment 1:\n",
            "so chuck i've got an obscure one for you okay okay there's a fellow named einrich wilhelm olbers where are the papers they must be peer reviewed okay do you narrate the history channel or something so he lived in the late 1700s early 1800s and he formulated a question that i think had been banning about for a while but he's it's got his name on this okay he posed a a profound question which was why is the night sky dark okay i i mean i'm gonna save him some trouble i got the answer oh you have the answer okay because that answer didn't arrive until like the 1920s so you tell me you have an answer okay go ahead let me hear it as simple as this because it's night time boom because the sunset they were just there we saw it go down bro now it's dark okay no that ain't how that works okay okay all right so i'm going to say something mathematically subtle which is at the heart of this but i'm adding it just for people to hear the little bit of extra math but uh i could describe it without the math but i'd rather not okay right here it goes um let's take the sun for a moment okay all right and it has a certain size on the sky and there's a certain amount of light coming from the sun and it's it's very bright okay but there's something called surface brightness it's a very important term in astrophysics so it's not what the total brightness of the thing is it's how much light is coming from a particular area on the sky okay so that would be a surface brightness surface brightness okay so now watch what happens if i put the sun three times farther away right its area on the sky drops to one ninth of what it was before it goes as the square of the distance okay all right okay so it's oneninth as large okay because three times farther away it's like onethird it's height and it's onethird in the width and in the area you're down by a factor of nine okay so that's the mathematics of that right it's oneninth as large are you with me i'm with you okay i mean or as i would say is smaller okay good okay so but precisely one night not only that if it's three times farther away something called the inverse square law of light drops the total brightness by the distance squared so if it's three times farther away three squared is nine the brightness you're receiving from the sun is only oneninth of what it was before okay well wait a minute if the sun is oneninth is large and you're getting oneninth the light if you divide those two then oneninths cancel it has the same surface brightness as it did when it was closer oh well that was a neat little trick that's what i'm saying it's a it's a mathematical reality of the geometry of what's going on okay so what what that means is you could put the sun at any distance from you and a sight line to its surface will be just as bright as a sight line to a air a spot on its surface if it's close up right okay that makes sense okay so albers you you forgot about him right yeah tell me who didn't know why night time exists dumbass tom that's what it means in germany i'm ass in the dark so he said to himself if the universe is infinite okay then every sight line should land on a star and if every sight line lands on a star then the entire night sky should be as bright as the surface of the sun whoa it should be ablaze in light okay for this reason that i told you yes because even though you're moving them farther away they cancel out in the inverse ratio correct inverse square ratio right inverse square root okay so and so boom it's still just as bright so now doesn't matter yes so the surface brightness and you're talking about where you land on the sky right the site so if you have an infinite universe and stars are everywhere you'd have your sightline would eventually hit the surface of a star right and the surface of a star would then be just as bright i mean within the variations of stars you know be just as bright as the surface of the sun and so that was the paradox no darkness correct and so the night sky is not completely dark so the paradox is if we live in an infinite universe the night sky should be a blazing light and it's not so therefore we must not live in an infinite universe this was his conclusion okay right okay so nobody knows if we were living in an infinite universe we had no idea you had no idea all anybody ever knew were the stars at night and the fuzzy things were just fuzzy things we in fact we call them all nebulae which is latin for fuzzy thing all right and only in the 1920s with the work of edwin hubble 1926 he was going to show that the spiral fuzzy things in the night sky are at huge distances from us and in fact they're twins of our own milky way their other galaxies so the universe maybe we don't think of it as filled with stars maybe it's filled with galaxies but same difference you would still land on a star in that other galaxy so he first discovers that but then here was the kicker 1929 he discovers that the universe is expanding oh my gosh so you know what that means it means the starlight dims at a faster rate than one over the distance square the one over the the inverse square law of light right because the light is trying to reach you and the universe says that it's almost pulled away i'm going no i'm going to stretch you out too well and dilute you before you even get to your destination what so even if we did live in an infinite universe at the time unknown the fact that we're in an expanding universe is sufficient to solve albert's paradox look at that that's right that i mean that's pretty fascinating it is and and the speed of light is finite it's not infinite so a second solution to the paradox is if you go far enough in the universe even if it wasn't expanding even if we were not in an expanding universe you could reach a point where the universe is not old enough for the light from that object to have reached you right so you're not adding up all this light that his original thought experiment would give you because the light just isn't there even if it is there waiting to knock on your front door right because it hasn't reached your front door yet exactly so by the 1920s like an uber on that little app you see where the car is you know it's there but it's not it's not there to pick you up yet right yeah it's it's well except yeah we presume the uber's right it's not exactly phantom shadow of an uber so so it's an interesting fact that this paradox had multiple sort of inline solutions that solved it otherwise right there'd be no dark sky period super cool man yeah no no yeah we could have we could have lived in a finite universe right the stars in our galaxy that's it you know and that's not enough stars for every sight line to land on one so yeah yeah wow that's pretty that's absolutely cool it's called olbers paradox right and what it does is it reaffirms for us the fact that even if the actual universe were infinite the fact that the speed of light is not infinite tells us we only see out to our horizon that's it you don't see you can't see to infinity because the speed of light is limited so who would have known that the the paradox had multiple solutions for it so you don't always get that in science yeah well it's i think you certainly don't get that by going mommy why is it so dark so i would say when your kids say why is it dark at night right if you say cause the sun set because no you you you no you're the dumbass exactly mommy why does his blessings get dark at night well sweetie you know clearly this so you trying to tell me you don't know albert's paradigm i was just saying mom yeah yeah the eightyearold i just listened to star talk and you idiot there you go kids if you want to be able to call your parents idiots go look up ober's paradox and then ask them why does it get dark in all fairness to parents that day will happen with or without us so you might that day will arrive okay so true it's so true so might as well be in the safe space of star talk right where you can have that happen let it be in service to science exactly yeah that's cool so that's it chuck that's ober's paradox that's very cool i love it i love ogre's paradox you got it you got it i apologize to him publicly i know he's dead but i'm going to still apologize clearly you're not as dumb as i thought well no you can do that's you can give a better apology than that clearly you're smarter than i ever thought i was how about that oh well there you go that would be an honest apology that's an honest apology yeah all right chuck always good to have you man always a pleasure star talk explainer video neil degrasse tyson keep looking up\n",
